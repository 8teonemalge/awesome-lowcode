## The History and Development of Ex-Yu Rock Music
 
Ex-Yu rock music refers to the rock music produced in the former Yugoslavia and its successor states from the 1960s to the present day. It encompasses a variety of genres, styles, and influences, reflecting the diversity and complexity of the region's history, culture, and politics.
 
The origins of ex-Yu rock music can be traced back to the 1960s, when the first Yugoslav rock bands emerged, influenced by the Western rock and roll, beat, and pop music. Some of the pioneers of this period were Bijelo Dugme, Crvena Jabuka, Indexi, Korni Grupa, Parni Valjak, Smak, Time, and Zlatni De√Ñ¬çaci. These bands introduced original songs and lyrics in Serbo-Croatian language, as well as covers of foreign hits. They also experimented with different instruments, such as keyboards, synthesizers, and electric guitars.

The 1970s saw the rise of hard rock, progressive rock, and heavy metal bands in Yugoslavia, such as Atomsko Skloni√Ö¬°te, Divlje Jagode, Galija, Leb i Sol, Riblja √Ñ¬åorba, YU Grupa, and Zabranjeno Pu√Ö¬°enje. These bands incorporated elements of folk music, classical music, jazz, and blues into their sound. They also expressed social and political criticism in their lyrics, often using humor and satire.
 
The 1980s marked the golden age of ex-Yu rock music, as well as the beginning of its fragmentation. The new wave movement (novi val) emerged as a reaction to the stagnation and commercialization of the mainstream rock scene. The new wave bands were influenced by punk rock, post-punk, ska, reggae, and synth-pop. Some of the most notable representatives of this movement were Azra, Bajaga i Instruktori, Bijelo Dugme (in their later phase), Elektri√Ñ¬çni Orgazam, Film, Haustor, Idoli, Laibach (in their early phase), Pankrti (the first Yugoslav punk band), Prljavo Kazali√Ö¬°te (in their early phase), √Ö arlo Akrobata (the first Yugoslav post-punk band), and VIS Idoli.
 
The new wave movement also spawned several subgenres and scenes in different parts of Yugoslavia. For example,
 
- in Sarajevo , there was a scene called novi primitivizam (new primitivism), which combined rock music with folk humor and absurdism. Some of the bands from this scene were Bombaj √Ö tampa , Elvis J. Kurtovi√Ñ¬á & His Meteors , Plavi Orkestar , Top Lista Nadrealista , and Zabranjeno Pu√Ö¬°enje .
- in Belgrade , there was a scene called beogradski novi talas (Belgrade new wave), which featured bands with a more experimental and avant-garde approach to music. Some of the bands from this scene were Beograd , Disciplina Ki√Ñ¬çme , Du Du A , Ekatarina Velika , Luna , Obojeni Program , Partibrejkers , Radni√Ñ¬çka Kontrola , √Ö arlo Akrobata , and U √Ö kripcu .
- in Zagreb , there was a scene called zagreba√Ñ¬çka √Ö¬°kola novog vala (Zagreb school of new wave), which was characterized by a more melodic and pop-oriented style of music. Some of the bands from this scene were Aerodrom , Azra , Boa , Film , Haustor , Jura Stubli√Ñ¬á & Film , Paraf , Prljavo Kazali√Ö¬°te (in their later phase), Psihomodo Pop , Srebrna Krila , and Vje√Ö¬°tice .
- in Ljubljana , there was a scene called ljubljanska alternativna scena (Ljubljana alternative scene), which was influenced by industrial music, noise music,
