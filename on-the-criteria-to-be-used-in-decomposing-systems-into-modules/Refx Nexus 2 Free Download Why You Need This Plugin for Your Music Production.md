## What is Refx Nexus 2 VST Plugin?
 
Refx Nexus 2 VST plugin is a futuristic virtual synthesizer that uses readymade sounds to fulfill your musical desires.

You can use it to make dance music, hip hop, classical music, folk music, or any other genre you can think of. You don't need any programming skills to use Refx Nexus 2, as it has a simple and intuitive interface that lets you browse, tweak, and mix sounds with just a few clicks. You can also add effects, arpeggios, trance gates, reverbs, and more to enhance your sounds.
 
However, Refx Nexus 2 is not a real synthesizer, as it cannot generate or record your own samples. It is a ROMpler that uses pre-recorded sounds from various sources.
