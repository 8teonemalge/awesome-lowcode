MONARK is based on the low-level modular DSP framework of REAKTOR CORE and uses Zero-Delay Feedback technology to eliminate the sample delay normally produced when modeling analog circuits involving feedback. This results in a more accurate and realistic sound that is hard to distinguish from the real thing. MONARK's engineers also relied on their ears to fine-tune the sound, combining advanced scientific research with refined human perception and a deep understanding of synthesis.
 
MONARK is easy to use, with a simple layout that consists of three oscillators, a smooth filter and amp section, and essential fine tuning, modulation, and glide controls. You can create thundering basses, thick leads, and expressive melodies with just a few tweaks. MONARK also integrates perfectly with the MASCHINE family, giving you hands-on control over your sound.
 
MONARK is the ultimate virtual analog synth for any style of music, from electronic and hip hop to indie rock and beyond. It delivers the true sound of a synth as famous as the artists who used it, and is the holy grail of analog modeling. Download MONARK v1.0 (Full Crack) today and experience the power and richness of the king of analog synths.

MONARK v1.0 is not just a faithful emulation of a classic synth, but also a versatile and creative tool that can inspire new sounds and ideas. You can tweak every parameter of the synth, from the oscillator waveforms and sync modes to the filter resonance and feedback amount.
