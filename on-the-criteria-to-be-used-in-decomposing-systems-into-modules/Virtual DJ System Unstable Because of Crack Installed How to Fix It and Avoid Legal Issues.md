## Why You Should Avoid Using Cracked Software
 
Cracked software is software that has been illegally modified or hacked to bypass the license verification or activation process. Some people may use cracked software to avoid paying for the original product or to access features that are not available in their version. However, using cracked software is not only unethical and illegal, but also risky and harmful for your computer and your data. Here are some reasons why you should avoid using cracked software:
 
- Cracked software may contain malware, viruses, trojans, keyloggers, or other malicious programs that can infect your computer, steal your personal information, damage your files, or compromise your security.
- Cracked software may not work properly or cause errors, crashes, or compatibility issues with your system or other software. It may also interfere with the updates or patches that are released by the original developers to fix bugs or improve performance.
- Cracked software may violate the terms of use or the intellectual property rights of the original developers. You may face legal consequences or penalties if you are caught using cracked software.
- Cracked software may deprive you of the benefits of using the official version, such as customer support, technical assistance, warranty, updates, features, or quality.

Therefore, it is always advisable to use only the official version of any software that you purchase or download from a trusted source. This way, you can ensure that you are using a safe, reliable, and legal product that meets your needs and expectations.
 
## How to Remove the Traces of the Crack from Your System
 
If you have previously installed a cracked version of Virtual DJ on your computer, you may need to remove the traces of the crack from your system before you can use the official version. The crack may have modified some files or settings that prevent you from logging in to your account or connecting to the Virtual DJ servers. To remove the traces of the crack from your system, you can follow these steps:

1. Uninstall Virtual DJ from your computer using the Control Panel or the uninstaller program that came with it.
2. Delete any remaining files or folders related to Virtual DJ from your hard drive. You can use a program like CCleaner or Revo Uninstaller to help you find and remove any leftover files.
3. Download and run a tool that can fix the host files that were altered by the crack. The host files are files that map domain names to IP addresses on your computer. The crack may have changed some entries in these files to redirect you to fake or malicious websites instead of the real ones.
