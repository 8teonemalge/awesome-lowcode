# Gatecycle 60 Gerar: A New Audiobook Series for Power Plant Enthusiasts
 
If you are interested in learning more about the design and performance of thermal power plants, you might want to check out Gatecycle 60 Gerar, a new audiobook series that covers various topics related to GateCycle software. GateCycle is a commercially available, fully flexible heat and mass balance program for Microsoft Windows that is used to model the steady state design and off-design performance of thermal power plants[^4^]. GateCycle provides a palette of common power plant equipment icons that can be used to construct detailed models of fossil, combined cycle, simple cycle and nuclear power plants[^4^].
 
Gatecycle 60 Gerar is a series of 60-minute audiobooks that explain the basics of GateCycle software, its features and applications, and how to use it to model different types of power plants. The series is narrated by Oumou Lopez and Ebony, two experienced power plant engineers who have used GateCycle software for many years. They share their insights, tips and tricks, and best practices for using GateCycle software effectively. The series is available on SoundCloud[^1^] [^2^], where you can listen to it online or download it for offline listening.
